# tokenwach

Continuing with my research into tokens and blockchain assets I found another site called [TokenMarket.net](https://tokenmarket.net/). This site includes ICOs which are running as well as upcoming campaigns.

In a similar fashion as previous post ([http://blog.bradlucas.com/posts/2017-07-01-coin-market-cap/](http://blog.bradlucas.com/posts/2017-07-01-coin-market-cap/)) I decided to scrape the site so I could group the entries by status more easily. The result of this is a Python script called `tokenwatch.py`.



## Usage

```
$ python tokenwatch.py
```
